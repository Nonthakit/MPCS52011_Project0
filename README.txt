# Compiling

To compile the source code, make sure you have GNU compiler in your environment.
Then run `g++ assembler.cpp -o hack_assembler`

# Usage

To use the program run command:

Linux: `./hack_assembler <asm_file_path>`

Window: `hack_assembler.exe <asm_file_path>`

`file_path` has to have .asm extension. The output will be the same filename with
.hack extension within the same directory as input file.
